## Script

We'll conclude the project. Feel free to fill out the missing sections of the journal. For now we will go with what you have there. It's all about shipping, so I would like to ask everybody to tell us what you commit to. We'll go around and everybody will get to the front, tell us what their project is, what is it for, and when you will ship. Feel free to hold yourself and others accountable.
