## Script

We'll conclude the workshop by going back to the beginning. You brought a word. Now you will take away a word. Write down on a sticky note one word you want to take away from today. This can be your impression, something you learnt, something you want to remember, your choice. When everybody has written down a word, everybody will show and read it.

Take the sticky note with you.

I'll send you an email with links to the material. And will ask you for some feedback on the workshop.

I hope it was fun and worthwhile for you. Thank you for participating. Have a good day.
