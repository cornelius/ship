We'll get some introductions done, so that everybody knows each other. In addition to that I ask everybody to bring one word. This could be how you feel, what you expect, what you would like to contribute, what you like, or something completely different. There are no rules, so you can't get it wrong.

Now please everybody write down your word on a sticky note. Then everybody, one after each other will put the sticky note on the wall.

One minute time to write the word.

Now Please come to the wall, say your name and your team, put up your sticky note and say one sentence to explain it.
