# Ship early, ship often

I recently did the [altMBA](https://altmba.com), an intense four week workshop around leadership created by the author, marketer, and blogger [Seth Godin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin). As part of the workshop we shipped twelve projects. The thirteenth project is to pay it forward and teach what we learned to others.

I do project thirteen as a half-day workshop for my co-workers. This repository contains the material for this workshop.

The topics of the workshop revolve around leadership and management. They cover areas such as goal setting, decision making, ideation, story telling, facilitating change, motivation, shipping projects, feedback, and dealing with your own resistance. It will be a hands-on workshop.

Those who have read some book by Seth Godin or follow his blog will suspect that the workshop is taking an unusual perspective. While it covers a lot of techniques, methods, and some theory, it emphasizes personal posture, something which Seth describes as "seeking out emotional labor" or "dancing with fear". It's a fascinating and very empowering perspective, and I will give my best to share what this means with you.

You don't have to be in a manager or a technical role to benefit from this workshop. It's useful for everybody who wants to make a difference, for yourself or for others.

## The story

The altMBA touches a lot of topics. One recurring theme is shipping. Shipping your work, shipping your projects, During the four weeks of the altMBA we shipped twelve projects.

The ShipIt Journal encapsulates the process of shipping. It lets you write down what is required to ship your project. It goes through many of the aspects you need to think and act through. Goal setting, addressing your resistance, audience and influencers, action planning, reframing your thinking, appreciation.

An essential element of the altMBA is feedback, giving feedback, receiving feedback, and reflecting on the feedback you got.

This workshop will use the ShipIt Journal as a guide to go through some of the steps of shipping a project. Each participant will fill it out for their own project. For each step there will be an introduction highighting concepts and techniques useful for the step. After filling out the corresponding section of the journal, there will be a round of feedback in the large or in smaller groups.

We will conclude by everybody committing to their personal project.
